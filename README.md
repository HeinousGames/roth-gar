# roth-gar
An incredibly personalized Android Application for RothGar the Ranger

# Specifications

This is a "Hello World" equivalent application written in Kotlin. Specifically, build instruction should be included for building the application on an "Amazon Fire 10." This is an Amazon OS build of Android.

This "hello world" equivalent won't actually say "hello world".

Instead, centered in the middle of the screen will be:

*  a single text form (Think of this HTML equivalent name field:https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp)
*  a single button with text "Roll"

The action of the form is to put a random number from 1 to 20 inside of the box whenever the 'roll' button is pressed.
